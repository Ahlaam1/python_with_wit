I learnt python and I kept myself motivated with being witty and sarcastic in the code.
=======
This is a little journey of mine through python. 
I love to read, and write, and make fun stuff that a person can represent with words, and I had to learn how to code. 
So I chose to add wit to the code to motivate me. 
This repo covers the fundamentals of python.
Have fun laughing whiles "reading" code which by the way, rarely happens. Does it even ever?
